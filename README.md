# foundry Defi StableCoin

## About
Decentralized Stablecoin (DSC) is a smart contract designed using Solidity. This coin is pegged to a value-stabilizing asset such as the US dollar, allowing for increased liquidity and wider acceptance in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

The codebase utilizes Foundry, a framework for building secure and scalable smart contract systems. It also employs various DeFi patterns, such as the "Vault" model for providing users with stable exposure to underlying assets.

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for setting up and using the DSC in a Foundry environment.
